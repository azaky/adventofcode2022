# Advent of Code 2022

I took advantage of this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022) as an opportunity to learn a new language, [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

## Running

I'm using [`cargo-script`](https://github.com/DanielKeep/cargo-script) to run single Rust file quickly.

```bash
cargo install cargo-script
```

To run something:

```bash
cargo script 01-calorie-counting.rs
```
