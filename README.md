# Advent of Code 2022

I took advantage of this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022) as an opportunity to learn a new language, [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

## Running

I'm using [`rust-script`](https://rust-script.org/) to run single Rust file quickly.

```bash
cargo install rust-script
```

To run something:

```bash
./run 01
```
